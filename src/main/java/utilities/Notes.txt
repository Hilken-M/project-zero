Scenario for reference:
Customer activates app (enters store) and is provided a list of item that they can purchase including those items price
for each item they select, they should be asked the quantity of that item they would like. We can confirm the quantity
then ask if they would like any more food or checkout? This will continue until they choose checkout at which time
we will add up their total and print out a receipt.
The receipt will include Item Name, quantity, and price along with a total quantity and total price at the bottom. They
can then leave or quickly grab another item?

Header (welcome sign)
Menus: list of inventory (item, qty, price), ask how many of the item they want, check out or continue,
and the last one leave (print the receipt) or quickly run back in and grab another item? (this will start the program over).
#Menus: 4
